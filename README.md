# HANNAH
An ELIZA chatbot written in Python by Josh Taro.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to:
- Explore how one of the earliest natural language processing program worked.
- Become familiarized with the use of regular expressions.
- Learn the specifics on using PyCharm.

## Usage
1. Simply download 'HANNAH-ChatBot.zip'.
2. Unpack 'HANNAH-ChatBot' and go into the folder 'HANNAH'.
3. Run 'main.py' to start the program.

## Future Improvements
While I'm happy with where my program is currently at, it can't account for all user inputs; further user input templates are needed in order to allow for HANNAH to give more detailed responses to the user.
